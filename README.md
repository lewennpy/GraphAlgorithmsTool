# GraphAlgorithmsTool
This Python program loads a weighted graph from a file and lets the user apply common graph algorithms:  Dijkstra  Floyd-Warshall  Prim  Kruskal  Breadth-First Search (BFS)  Depth-First Search (DFS)  The user selects the algorithm, inputs start/end nodes if needed, and the program shows the path or traversal and total cost.
